        I'm Alejandra Mari√±o Parra, a mathematics graduate from Colombia with a
        strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving. My
        academic background has equipped me with the skills to approach complex
        challenges with precision and logic. I enhanced my English proficiency
        while living in the United States, achieving an advanced level of
        fluency, and I am a native Spanish speaker. Currently, I am focused on
        advancing my expertise in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence,
        driven by a deep passion for technology, innovation, and continuous
        learning.
